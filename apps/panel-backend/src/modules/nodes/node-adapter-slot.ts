 * A-055: one inbound per adapter on a node, where the agent holds one.
 *
 * The agent hands an inbound to an adapter by the pair (protocol, engine),
 * and for AmneziaWG by (protocol, generation) (server.go:1113-1127, adapterFor).
 * Every adapter but native xray keeps ONE inbound: a second one pushed to it
 * silently replaces the first, so the operator sees two hosts and the node
 * serves one. List from the agent window, read in code 22.10:
 *   - single: hysteria, naive, shadowsocks, mtproto, mieru (native);
 *   - AmneziaWG: one per generation, 1.x and 3.1 apart;
 *   - sing-box: one per protocol (tuic, anytls, the xray family, hysteria,
 *     shadowsocks, shadowtls);
 *   - many: xray on xray, and mieru since the agent's f8bac16.
 *
 * Refused here, by name, until the agent ships multi-inbound for a pair; then
 * that pair joins MULTI_INBOUND_ADAPTERS (packages/shared, adapters.ts, one
 * line, read by the screen too) and the refusal lifts for it alone.
